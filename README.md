# DeepLearning
Pytorch and Tensorflow implementation of various Deep Learning Algorithms like :- 

* Perceptron, Linear recession, Gradient Descent, Deep NN, Dropout concepts implementation through pytorch
* Created a tensor flow model miniFlow, that goes inside the concepts of tensor flow and how it works from python.
* MNIST data processing through tensor flow. 
* Stereo Vision Block Config through tensor flow. A guided project.
* *Deep learning udacity course projects*
